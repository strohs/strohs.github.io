        details: |
          Yap was a start-up company that pioneered the world’s first high accuracy, automated speech recognition 
          platform for “long duration” dialogues. I was one of the initial members of Yap’s engineering team and 
          helped build the company’s back-end infrastructure from a proof-of-concept application to a cloud based 
          SaaS platform. Yap was acquired by Amazon.com in March 2012 and used to help build Amazon Alexa.
            - Implemented multiple REST APIs that ingested audio files, queued them for processing by speech recognition engines and then returned the transcribed results to clients
            - Lead all service engagments with Yap’s corporate customers, responsible for integrating Yap’s APIs into their exiting front-end/back-end infrastructure
            - Developed text post processing algorithms utilized by Yap's transcription APIs. These algorithms punctuated, sanitized, and (in some cases) improved transcription accuracy before being sent to our customers
